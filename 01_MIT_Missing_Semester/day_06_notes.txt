Debuggging and Profiling

Debug using the log and ad hoc print statement.

Profiling, somehow, means to optimization the running of code.
- In r, Rprofile works fine.
- In Python, I will go check which 3rd party tool can be used.

Rescource Monitoring,
The idea is the CPU time and Kernal time are not usually the real/clock time. And the jobs not always take all the resources of CPU GPU and so on. 

Check the following link if Rescource Monitoring is needed.

Well, I guess this should run the code from terminal instead of using other IDE r-studio, Interactive-computing-environment like jupyter-notebook, or General code editor like VS-code.
