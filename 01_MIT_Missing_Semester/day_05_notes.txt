Version Control Using Git

Consider a repo
root
- foo   -> folder is called as a tree
  -- bar.txt  -> the file is called as blob
- bar.txt -> this file is also called as blob.

blol is treated as an array of bytes.
tree is a mapping from a string (its name) to a tree (sub-folder) or blob (file).
commit is a structured record.
commit = struct{
         parents: an array of commits,
         author: string,
         message: string,
         snapshot: tree/folder
}

Git init, git status, git add, git commit.
As a magic way to show the git log when there are multiple contributors: git log --all --graph --decorate

git checkout to switch the workding directory to a history version.
git diff to check the difference made since last commit.
